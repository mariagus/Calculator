## Calculator

I built this calculator app as part of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator) front-end libraries project. Working on this project helped me come to grips with concepts such as `state` and `props`.

## Tech stack

- React
